# GameHub

Multiplayer game portal written in VueJS that let's you play realtime javascript/canvas games built with my own 2D game engine.
It uses a MySQL database and Socket.io for the realtime communication between the clients.

It has the following features:

* Experience/rank based matchmaking
* Configurable game settings before each game (game speed, game length and other parameters)

* Touchscreen and keyboard controls
* Personalizable user profile (avatar, bio...)
* Realtime chat in the lobby
* User statuses
